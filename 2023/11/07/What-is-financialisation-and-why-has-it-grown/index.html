    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p>
<p>Over the past decade, discussions over the term ‘financialization’ among scholars has<br>emerged dramatically, with the annually published journal articles on financialization more<br>than quadrupled (Web of Science 2019, quoted in Mader et al. 2020). Books and publications<br>about financialization have grown from a handful number since the beginning of the<br>millennium to more than a dozen published each year, particularly after the 2008 financial<br>crisis. (WorldCat, 2019, quoted in Mader et al. 2020) Debates about financialization over its<br>definition, features and effects are fierce and transdisciplinary (Mader, Mertans and Zwan<br>2020). The topic of financialization is not only limited to Economics and Political studies but<br>also involves sociology, anthropology, and geography studies. The essence of financialization<br>is intricate and heterogeneous, for instance, Malcolm Sawyer (2014) suggests that financial<br>development is positively related to economic development but meanwhile injects fragility<br>into society; while Gerald Epstein (2005) argues that there is a negative correlation between<br>the financial power and the society’s well-being. This essay aims to introduce financialization<br>from different aspects and address its importance and operational mechanism. In the essay,<br>firstly the definition of financialization given by representative scholars will be discussed in<br>terms of their width and depth; after that, we will look into the causes of financialization and<br>why has it grown. Finally, the effects of financialization on society will be assessed. </p>
<p><strong>Conceptualisation of financialisaton</strong> </p>
<p>Considering the broad number of definitions given by different scholars from various<br>backgrounds, it is necessary to set up a standard before we investigate those definitions in<br>order to anchor our analysis. Philip Mader, Daniel Mertens and Natascha van der Zwan (2020)<br>pointed out two risks when conceptualising financialization due to its transdisciplinary nature.<br>The first risk is conceptual dilution: if the adoption of the term ‘financialization’ across various<br>disciplines requires a generic understanding of its meaning, then the concept of<br>financialization will lose its scientific value. In other words, its methodological value to<br>generalize the world and create a precise common language for scholars to discuss and serve<br>as a ‘data container”(Sartori 1970), otherwise, when people are discussing financialization,<br>each of them might mean a different thing. Another risk is solidification: if one standardized<br>definition becomes the norm in a particular sub-field, then a too rigid understanding of<br>financialization will lead to blindness of its analysis across its causes and effects on different<br>areas. To sum up, financialization is a term too broad to be defined as one single definition,<br>a successful definition of financialization should follow these principles: 1) limiting, explicitly<br>distinguish what falls into the category of financialization 2) mechanism-oriented, to involve<br>the linkage of cause and effect 3) contextual, clarifies in what context the definition is valid<br>(Mader, Mertans and Zwan 2020)<br>Natascha van der Zwan (2014) provided us with a helpful tool to organise definitional issues<br>and approaches, she classified three levels of analysis to the conceptualization of<br>financialization, they are: (a)macro-level approach, which focuses on a macroeconomicaggregate level and often engages with a state/market-dichotomy in the process of<br>financialization (b)meso-level approach, which emphasis on businesses and its changing<br>relations with financial markets. (c) micro-level, which keeps an eye on how (mostly ordinary)<br>individual agents are involved in the process of financialization.<br>“The origins of the term ‘financialization’ are obscure”, said Malcolm Sawyer (2014), “… the<br>current usage of the term ‘financialization’ owes much to the work of Kevin Philips.” Philips<br>(1994, quoted in Sawyer M. 2014:6) defined financialization as “a prolonged split between the<br>divergent of real and financial economies.” This is a rough and raw definition of which<br>elements within that definition need to be further defined. Later at the start of the millennium,<br>three widely accepted definitions were given by Gerald Epstein(2005), Greta Krippner(2005)<br>and Engelbert Stockhammer (2004). Epstein and Krippner both focused on a macro level of<br>analysis, Epstein defined financialization as: “ the increasing role of financial motives, financial<br>markets, financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and<br>international economies.” While Krippner defined financialization as : “ A pattern of<br>accumulation in which profits accrue primarily through financial channels rather than through<br>trade and commodity production.”. Epstein’s definition contains a broad range of sectors that<br>performs financial power. Overall, it achieved an appropriate balance between conceptual<br>dilution and solidification by providing the object of study, but there are still flaws in it as it<br>does not specify the time period and geographical space it applies. (Sawyer M.2014) In<br>comparison, Krippner’s definition is more specific in the aspect of ‘profit-financialisaton’, his<br>definition can be seen as a modified version of Philip’s definition given at the beginning of<br>this paragraph, it classified ‘divergent of real and financial economies’ as profit attained<br>primarily through financial channels rather than trading of actual commodities. Differ from<br>Epstein and Krippner, Stockhammer’s conceptualisation of finalisation lies on a meso-level of<br>analysis, he defined it as: “increased activity of non-financial businesses on financial markets,<br>[…] measured by the corresponding income streams.” (Stockhammer, 2004) Stockhammer’s<br>definition provides a clear context of a business environment in which financialization occurs,<br>furthermore, it is also mechanism oriented as the cause (increased activity), subject(nonfinancial businesses), consequences and measurements (corresponding income steams) are<br>all involved. This essay suggests a flexible adoption of these definitions, considering the<br>transdisciplinary nature of finalisation, all the definitions mentioned above have their<br>emphasises and missing parts, when discussing finalisation, one should first clarify the area<br>and subject he is studying and then set up his approach or level of analysis for choosing the<br>appropriate definition to use. </p>
<p><strong>Why has financialisaton grown?</strong> </p>
<p>Even though the origin of financialization as a term to be used remains obscure, the point<br>where the current wave of financialization as a process occurred is obvious. Figure I and II<br>illustrates the US financial assets as percentage of GDP and US financial industry profits as a<br>share of total US economy profits, they both showed a significant rise during the 1980s, where<br>the value of financial assets as percentage of GDP more than doubled from 194% to 417%<br>during the period and financial industry profits as a share of total economy profits for the first<br>time broke 20% to 30% in 1993. </p>

<p>The data provided us with a valuable starting point to discuss the growth of finalisation, to<br>answer why has financialization grown, we should firstly excavate what happened during the<br>1980s. In August 1981, President Ronald Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act that<br>began a series of economic reforms lead by neo-liberal thoughts (Steger and Roy, 2010) to<br>reduce government involvement in the economy by structural changes such as reduction in<br>both individual and corporate tax rate, the expensing of depreciable property and<br>government regulation. (Presidential Foundation&amp; Institute). Similar economic reforms were<br>adopted by Margret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and soon spread across the world. This<br>suggests that financialization is positively correlated with encourage of market-led economic<br>mechanisms, this finding corresponds to the FESSUE (Financialisaton Economy Society and<br>Sustainable Development) description of financialization that the process of financialization<br>has been closely interwoven with deregulation of the financial system itself and the economy<br>more generally. (FESSUD 2011, quoted in Sawyer M, 2014) Yingyao Wang(2015), used the<br>empirical case study of China to illustrate the importance of institutional infrastructure in the<br>process of financialization. She argues that the Chinese case of financialization contains three<br>processes: the introduction of shareholder value by the state to manage its assets that leads<br>to an increase in the number of state asset management organisations and the availability of<br>structured investment vehicles to finance fixed asset investments. Duménil and Lévy (2001,<br>quoted in Epstein, 2005) see financialization, neoliberalism and globalization as three deeply<br>related phenomena that mark the current world economy. They argue that neoliberalism is<br>the ‘ideological expression of the reassertion of the power of finance” and that the return of<br>finance to hegemony was “accomplished in close connection with the internationalization of<br>capital and the globalization of markets.” (p.579) Technological innovation accelerates the<br>process of financialization, with the improvement in telecommunication, information could<br>be exchanged in an unprecedented pace. Alongside is the introduction of the computer that<br>enabled quantitative trading, made possible for countless transactions to occur within<br>seconds. There are also cultural effects contribute to financialization, as stated by<br>FESSUD(2011, quoted in Sawyer M, 2014) that: “Consumption has often been sustained by<br>the extension of credit, not least through the use of capital gains in housing as collateral. […]<br>Financialization is associated with a particular culture which is to be interpreted broadly.”<br>Before I make a conclusion of this paragraph, I would like to bring up Malcolm Sawyer(2014)’s<br>point that the term ‘financialization’ is not limited to a specific period or place. The analysis<br>of this essay is focused on the post-80s financialization led by the United State because its<br>degree is unprecedented, and its influence is ever-lasting. The causes of post-80s<br>financialization can be included as 1) Structural change led by neo-liberal principles made by<br>major economic entities such as The United States, The United Kingdom, and The People’s<br>Republic of China. 2) Technological innovation that improves the efficiency of financial<br>transactions vastly. 3) Change in the social environment that made individuals to be more<br>engaged in financial activities. Financialization is the process of these three factors consistently<br>interacting and enhancing each other that shapes society. </p>
<p>The effects of financialization </p>
<p>The impact of financialization is another controversial topic, with scholars including Epstein,<br>Godechot and Andreas Nölke arguing that financialization is fundamentally detrimental to<br>our society, which promotes instability and inequality. Epstein (2005:5) remarked such<br>influence in his book Introduction: Financialization and the World Economy that: “ […] that<br>some effects of financialization – in concert with neoliberalism and globalization – have been<br>highly detrimental to significant numbers of people around the globe.” In terms of inequality,<br>Godechot(2020) addressed inequality fueled by financialization in micro-level between<br>individuals, he argues that financialization has created “a niche with very high wages”. Within<br>those niches, financiers have a “hold up power” over their firms, such power increases the<br>finance wage premium gap and produces a sharp increase in wage inequality. Bruno Bonizzi,<br>Annina Kaltenbrunner and Jeff Powell (2022) analyzed inequality between the countries. They<br>pointed out a ‘subordinate’ state of which developing countries are integrated into the global<br>economy, the US dollar market-based finance and the internationalization of productive<br>capital, altered the geographic transfer of value from subordinate regions to superordinate<br>ones. The hierarchical nature is embedded in global monetary and production relations. In<br>terms of instability, figure 3<br>depicts the frequency of banking crisis by year. There is a period<br>during the 1940s to 1970s, under the Bretton Woods system of which global capital flows<br>were strongly constrained, financial crisis rarely occurred. But since the 1980s, the time point<br>that current financialization began, the financial crisis again became a frequent, clinical event<br>in the world economy.<br><img src="imgs/Image%20three%20financialisation.png" alt="img"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data clearly shows a transition and its repercussion from a Keynesian-guide Bretton<br>Wood economic system to the neoliberal one, as explained by Magdoff and Paul Sweezy<br>(1987), the expansion of the financial sector and peculiarly debt as a solution to the stagnation<br>that ended the United State’s post WWII economic boom has turned America into a ‘casino<br>society’.<br>Despite the fierce critics, scholars also discovered a strong positive relationship between<br>financial development and economic development. By a sufficient number of empirical<br>studies at both micro and macro levels, Levine (2005) suggests that there is a strong positive<br>link between the functioning of the financial system and long-run economic growth. Both<br>financial intermediaries and markets matter for growth, A well-functioned financial system<br>reduces external financial constraints facing firms, but current theory and evidence are not<br>able to show that financialization is merely an appendage or derivate of economic growth.<br>Later this positive correlation was evaluated by Beck, Degryseb and Kneer (2014), who<br>discovered a U-shaped relationship that shows the benefit of financial development on<br>economic growth only lasts to a certain point, since then the power of the financial sector<br>acts adversely to economic growth. They concluded that: “In the long run financial<br>intermediation increases growth and reduces growth volatility. […]Critically, financial system<br>size, especially non-intermediation service, has a positive relationship with volatility in highincome countries over the medium-term.” (Beck, Degryseb, and Kneer 2014:55) In addition<br>to their argument, Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012) focused on studying the relationship<br>between financial development and economic growth in the medium run among advanced<br>economies. Their data shows the U-shape pattern proposed by Beck, Degryseb and Kneer,<br>and discovered that the intermediation financial services are fundamentally detrimental to<br>productivity growth. Figure 4 shows the average private credit to GDP ratio on the x-axis and<br>average GDP per worker growth on the y-axis, the regression line shows that there is a<br>negative correlation between the two variables after the proportion of average private credit<br>to GDP exceeds 0.3 while the positive correlation between the two variables before that point<br>remains modest. The U-shape is more clearly shown in Figure 5 that the financial<br>intermediation services contribute positively to average GDP per-worker growth within the<br>range of -0.003 to 0.001. And figure 6 shows that there is a linear negative correlation<br>between the growth of average financial intermediation employment and average real GDPper-worker growth. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Financialization is an influential, ongoing process that has branches across various disciplines.<br>This essay has first introduced the methodology to assess the conceptualizations given by<br>different scholars, when conceptualizing, thinkers should first be explicit about their level of<br>analysis, and then be careful about the risks of conceptual dilution and solidification. Based<br>on such methodology, I assessed three popular definitions given by Gerald Epstein, Greta<br>Krippner and Engelbert Stockhammer, they are three distinctive approaches for us to<br>recognize financialization at a macro and meso level. Due to space limitations, the<br>conceptualization of financialization on the micro level is not mentioned. After that, this essay<br>looked into the causes of financialization in the post-80s context, which can be concluded as:<br>“ Initiated by structural change started in the United States and facilitated by technological<br>advancement and changing social culture.” In the last part of this essay, I assessed the effects<br>of financialization with empirical evidence and hard data. Financialization has an adverse<br>impact on medium-run economic growth, injects volatility into society and exacerbates<br>inequality with rich counties and individuals being even wealthier and the poor getting worse.<br>However, there is also a strong positive correlation between financial development and longrun economic growth. Given that the causality between the correlation is yet clear, it is<br>possible that these repercussions of financialization could be primarily caused by other<br>external factors and financialization just works as a catalyst.</p>
