          <p>The bureaucracy system is not necessarily an inefficient system at the very beginning, but as the orgnization grows with the additional duties and workers who carry the duties, the orgnizational structure will finally beome ineffeint.</p>
<p>While I was structuring this personal website, things were easy at first, I can found out where the bug is and fix it quickly. Thing became comlicated after I started to adding more functions to it becasue there are more and more codes in the database, the process of locating the problem is as hard as finding a “6” among one million “9”s. Last time it took me half the day to fix the dreadful bug that made the whole page a blank page.</p>
<p>I think that is why consluting comapanies are so expensive. To find the bug in an orignization with hundreds of thousands of people and duties and then fix it to imporve the efficiency of the firm.</p>
<p>Not an easy thing.</p>

          <p>(It is a social study programme that I did in the summer of 2019, I had a trip to the countryside of North JiangShu(苏北) and AnHui(安徽). I was too young to realize the economic problem behind it, even though what I wrote down is the actual image I saw, the report is still unrepresentative of the whole situation. In the 2-year time before I post this report online I went to more places of China, rural areas in the economically developed areas such as Shanghai(上海) and Zhejiang(浙江) are thriving and even the countryside in some “poor” provinces found their way out too. Again, what I wrote down is not a special case, but also not representative because China is too big) —— 2021/7/26   </p>
<p>Elders from the countryside are withering.</p>
<p>By the time when this report is finished, it was the end of the summer vacation. I spent almost the whole summer holiday walking around the rural areas of China, saw the condition of most of the elders from the countryside in China.</p>
<p>This topic seems like nonsense because human beings as a creature are supposed to be withering by the age. Indeed, I believe that everyone is witnessing the fading of themselves and the people around them all the time. Gradually, we are starting to be afraid of the annual physical examination, our hair is leaving our head and our bodies are getting tired easily. Like the poet described: “ When you are old and grey and full of sleep/And nodding by the fire.” Withering is happening every second on you and me, but what makes this process of ageing so special when it is about the elders in rural China? </p>
<p>I saw roughly the same picture in every countryside that I went: Air full of the disturbing sound of teenagers’ inferior motorcycles accompanied by the fitful coughing of old people sitting on the cane chair. It is hard to see people of working age on the road because it is almost impossible to have a job here. The depression itself is not sad, the sad thing is that the old people, no matter how hard they work, cannot avoid such a depression.</p>
<p>The majority of this generation was born before the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, at that time they worked hard but received little, as W. Somerset Maugham wrote in his book On a Chinese Screen, “In China it is man that is the beast of burden.” After that, it was the era of planned economy, because of the land reform they could directly feel the return of their labour without handling to the landlord, so they exhausted their energies to fulfil their Chinese Dream of having a fruitful, secured life. Since that until the Opening Up reformation that brought the free market to China, they had experienced the great Chinese Famine and the Culture Revolution. They are the most hard-working generation because of their unique youth experience, if you don’t work hard, you starve.  </p>
<p>Hard-working became their habit. They work until they can’t, they thought to chill is the crime of wasting your time. Their sons or daughters left their grandchildren in the village because they cannot take good care of them in such intensified work conditions in cities. Grandparents act as parents. Once their grandchildren are school-age that does not acquire so much energy to take care of, they will find a side business right away. Do anything they can to make a few bucks. The crops in the village are grown by these old people, it is common for a woman over seventy to plant twenty pounds of corn alone. </p>
<p>However, there is limited energy and life for humans. As time goes, this generation began to wither one after another, most of them worked to the end, few of them have chronic bedrest at the last stage of their life. Maybe for such a laborious generation, life ends when you cannot work. They are resistant to even being in the hospital as a waste of money. A few of them even committed suicide because they don’t have children to take care of them or the quality of care is poor. Who says farmers are irrational? To me, their rationality is hard to accept emotionally even though it is maybe the best choice in their position. As an onlooker, I feel sorry for them. </p>
<p>The appearance of new graves witnessed intuitively that a whole generation is becoming the past. The fields that they worked so hard to cultivate are being devoured by the luxuriant trees. The beautiful home that they devoted their lives to is not admired by youngers anymore. For some tombs, it is hardly to see people come and burn an incense stick.<br>——2019/8/23</p>
