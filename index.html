          <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Structure, an essential term to brought up when explaining political events which own a<br>feature of excludability, as addressed by William H. Sewell. Jr. (1992:2) that: “What tends to<br>get lost in the language of structure is the efficacy of human action – or ‘agency’.” This raises<br>the question of the level of importance between impersonal structures and individual agency<br>in understanding political events. Based on the duality structural theory by Anthony Giddens<br>and William H.’s modification of the theory, this essay analyses political turbulence using the<br>empirical case study of China’s cultural revolution to answer the question between impersonal<br>structure and individual agency. I argue that there is a dialectical relationship between the<br>former and the latter, there is no priority between the two prospects, and both need to be<br>addressed sufficiently in order to understand a political event such as domestic turmoil.</p>
<p><strong>The Duality of structure and its application in the Cultural Revolution.</strong></p>
<p>Anthony Giddens (1984:377, quoted in William H. 1992) defined structure as: “Rules and<br>resources, recursively implicated in the reproduction of social systems. Structure exists only<br>as memory traces, the organic basis of human knowledgeability, and as instantiated in action.”<br>What he means by this sentence is that structure must be regarded as “dual”, structure and<br>agency are not opposed, but acts presuppose to each other. The presupposed manner is<br>presented as the interaction between rules and resources. Rules, in Wittgenstein’s language,<br>are “generalizable procedures applied in the enactment/reproduction of social life”.<br>(Wittgenstein, 1984:21) The knowledge of rules makes individual agents capable of action<br>and such knowledge comes mainly from cultural backgrounds. While resources are the<br>material beings where power originates and allow it to exercise in social interactions. William’s<br>interpretation of the dialectical relationship between rules and resources is that: on the one<br>hand, resources are an instantiation of schemas, therefore inculcate and justify schemas; on<br>the other hand, schemas not empowered or reproduced by resources will unavoidably be<br>abandoned and forgotten. (William H. Sewell. Jr. 1992:13)<br>Gidden’s theory has perfect application in the cultural revolution, a political turmoil that lasted<br>for ten years that caused millions of deaths (Lucian W. Pye 1986:597), described by the<br>Chinese people as “Ten years of catastrophe” (十年浩劫). Here I argue that the Cultural<br>Revolution, an irrational political event, an event of “collective madness” (Anne F. Thurston<br>1984-1985), cannot be understood solely from a “structure” or “individual agency”<br>perspective. During this event, there is a top-down process that the duality of structure and<br>agency as rules and resources interacting and reinforcing each other finally led to this political<br>tragedy. This event first started in Mao Zedong, the supreme leader’s mind, then gradually<br>spread into the Chinese people’s minds and turned them into extremists and injected<br>murderous insanity into the society. Therefore, the Cultural Revolution can be explained by<br>three factors: 1) Mao’s personality, 2) Chinese traditional culture 3) People’s devotion to Mao.<br>(Lucian W. Pye 1986) It is the last two factors that enabled the first factor to initiate Cultural<br>Revolution by conducting it. As a country ruled by thousands of years of feudal monarchy<br>under tight control over its people, there is a tendency of the society to take seriously all that<br>was said and done by its leaders without doubts. Thus, any preferences of the Chinese leaders<br>automatically become the motives of their actions. (Lucian W. Pye 1986:601) Personally, in his<br>early life, Mao Zedong was educated in schools during the Qing dynasty based on Confucius<br>principles. (Panstov &amp; Levine, 2013:14-15) Despite his belief in Marxism later, the Confucius<br>convention that promotes patriotism and the ultimate goal of becoming sainted by bringing<br>good virtue and prosperity to society had a great influence on him. Rather than worshipping<br>a transcendental god, Confucianism idolizes great emperors. We can find the influence of<br>Confucianism on Mao in his poem Snow – to the tune of Chin Yuan Chun (1936), in which he<br>compared himself with great ancient leaders such as Genghis Khan and wrote: “All are past<br>and gone!/For truly great men/Look to this age alone.” Mao conducted Cultural Revolution<br>in the request for revolutionary immortality, in other words, to accomplish the ultimate goal<br>set by Confucius. The Chinese traditional culture made a vast number of human resources<br>available to the agent Mao, while this event was in process, each poster stuck, each massacre<br>toward intellectuals and progressists conducted, each “little red book” (sacred text for Mao’s<br>personality cult) printed, had reinforced Mao’s power and in the meanwhile made Mao more<br>determined in his catastrophic decision. (Lucian W. Pye 1986)<br>What can be discovered in the event of the Cultural Revolution is the unstoppable collective<br>power of structure and agents. This event would be impossible to occur without the two forces<br>acting in census. From solely a structural perspective, we cannot explain the motive behind<br>Mao to make this disastrous decision that ruins the country he once fought for; from solely<br>an agent perspective, we cannot explain why other powerful agents in the party such as Zhou<br>Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang, failed to stop this tragedy from happening.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the analysis of the Cultural Revolution through the lens of the duality of<br>structure and agency reveals that both impersonal structures and individual agency are<br>equally important in understanding political events. The Cultural Revolution is a prime<br>example of the dialectical relationship between structure as knowledgeable rules and agents<br>as human resources and how they interact to create a collective madness that leads to a<br>catastrophic event. Mao’s personality motivated him to initiate and conduct the Cultural<br>Revolution, while the Chinese political conventions provided the rules that justified Mao’s<br>power together with the Individual Chinese agent’s devotion that contributes to it. Therefore,<br>to understand a political event such as the Cultural Revolution, we need to examine both the<br>structural and the agential aspects of the event and the interaction between the two.<br>Ultimately, the analysis of the Cultural Revolution highlights the importance of taking a<br>nuanced and comprehensive approach to the study of political events.</p>

          <p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p>
<p>Over the past decade, discussions over the term ‘financialization’ among scholars has<br>emerged dramatically, with the annually published journal articles on financialization more<br>than quadrupled (Web of Science 2019, quoted in Mader et al. 2020). Books and publications<br>about financialization have grown from a handful number since the beginning of the<br>millennium to more than a dozen published each year, particularly after the 2008 financial<br>crisis. (WorldCat, 2019, quoted in Mader et al. 2020) Debates about financialization over its<br>definition, features and effects are fierce and transdisciplinary (Mader, Mertans and Zwan<br>2020). The topic of financialization is not only limited to Economics and Political studies but<br>also involves sociology, anthropology, and geography studies. The essence of financialization<br>is intricate and heterogeneous, for instance, Malcolm Sawyer (2014) suggests that financial<br>development is positively related to economic development but meanwhile injects fragility<br>into society; while Gerald Epstein (2005) argues that there is a negative correlation between<br>the financial power and the society’s well-being. This essay aims to introduce financialization<br>from different aspects and address its importance and operational mechanism. In the essay,<br>firstly the definition of financialization given by representative scholars will be discussed in<br>terms of their width and depth; after that, we will look into the causes of financialization and<br>why has it grown. Finally, the effects of financialization on society will be assessed. </p>
<p><strong>Conceptualisation of financialisaton</strong> </p>
<p>Considering the broad number of definitions given by different scholars from various<br>backgrounds, it is necessary to set up a standard before we investigate those definitions in<br>order to anchor our analysis. Philip Mader, Daniel Mertens and Natascha van der Zwan (2020)<br>pointed out two risks when conceptualising financialization due to its transdisciplinary nature.<br>The first risk is conceptual dilution: if the adoption of the term ‘financialization’ across various<br>disciplines requires a generic understanding of its meaning, then the concept of<br>financialization will lose its scientific value. In other words, its methodological value to<br>generalize the world and create a precise common language for scholars to discuss and serve<br>as a ‘data container”(Sartori 1970), otherwise, when people are discussing financialization,<br>each of them might mean a different thing. Another risk is solidification: if one standardized<br>definition becomes the norm in a particular sub-field, then a too rigid understanding of<br>financialization will lead to blindness of its analysis across its causes and effects on different<br>areas. To sum up, financialization is a term too broad to be defined as one single definition,<br>a successful definition of financialization should follow these principles: 1) limiting, explicitly<br>distinguish what falls into the category of financialization 2) mechanism-oriented, to involve<br>the linkage of cause and effect 3) contextual, clarifies in what context the definition is valid<br>(Mader, Mertans and Zwan 2020)<br>Natascha van der Zwan (2014) provided us with a helpful tool to organise definitional issues<br>and approaches, she classified three levels of analysis to the conceptualization of<br>financialization, they are: (a)macro-level approach, which focuses on a macroeconomicaggregate level and often engages with a state/market-dichotomy in the process of<br>financialization (b)meso-level approach, which emphasis on businesses and its changing<br>relations with financial markets. (c) micro-level, which keeps an eye on how (mostly ordinary)<br>individual agents are involved in the process of financialization.<br>“The origins of the term ‘financialization’ are obscure”, said Malcolm Sawyer (2014), “… the<br>current usage of the term ‘financialization’ owes much to the work of Kevin Philips.” Philips<br>(1994, quoted in Sawyer M. 2014:6) defined financialization as “a prolonged split between the<br>divergent of real and financial economies.” This is a rough and raw definition of which<br>elements within that definition need to be further defined. Later at the start of the millennium,<br>three widely accepted definitions were given by Gerald Epstein(2005), Greta Krippner(2005)<br>and Engelbert Stockhammer (2004). Epstein and Krippner both focused on a macro level of<br>analysis, Epstein defined financialization as: “ the increasing role of financial motives, financial<br>markets, financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and<br>international economies.” While Krippner defined financialization as : “ A pattern of<br>accumulation in which profits accrue primarily through financial channels rather than through<br>trade and commodity production.”. Epstein’s definition contains a broad range of sectors that<br>performs financial power. Overall, it achieved an appropriate balance between conceptual<br>dilution and solidification by providing the object of study, but there are still flaws in it as it<br>does not specify the time period and geographical space it applies. (Sawyer M.2014) In<br>comparison, Krippner’s definition is more specific in the aspect of ‘profit-financialisaton’, his<br>definition can be seen as a modified version of Philip’s definition given at the beginning of<br>this paragraph, it classified ‘divergent of real and financial economies’ as profit attained<br>primarily through financial channels rather than trading of actual commodities. Differ from<br>Epstein and Krippner, Stockhammer’s conceptualisation of finalisation lies on a meso-level of<br>analysis, he defined it as: “increased activity of non-financial businesses on financial markets,<br>[…] measured by the corresponding income streams.” (Stockhammer, 2004) Stockhammer’s<br>definition provides a clear context of a business environment in which financialization occurs,<br>furthermore, it is also mechanism oriented as the cause (increased activity), subject(nonfinancial businesses), consequences and measurements (corresponding income steams) are<br>all involved. This essay suggests a flexible adoption of these definitions, considering the<br>transdisciplinary nature of finalisation, all the definitions mentioned above have their<br>emphasises and missing parts, when discussing finalisation, one should first clarify the area<br>and subject he is studying and then set up his approach or level of analysis for choosing the<br>appropriate definition to use. </p>
<p><strong>Why has financialisaton grown?</strong> </p>
<p>Even though the origin of financialization as a term to be used remains obscure, the point<br>where the current wave of financialization as a process occurred is obvious. Figure I and II<br>illustrates the US financial assets as percentage of GDP and US financial industry profits as a<br>share of total US economy profits, they both showed a significant rise during the 1980s, where<br>the value of financial assets as percentage of GDP more than doubled from 194% to 417%<br>during the period and financial industry profits as a share of total economy profits for the first<br>time broke 20% to 30% in 1993. </p>

<p>The data provided us with a valuable starting point to discuss the growth of finalisation, to<br>answer why has financialization grown, we should firstly excavate what happened during the<br>1980s. In August 1981, President Ronald Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act that<br>began a series of economic reforms lead by neo-liberal thoughts (Steger and Roy, 2010) to<br>reduce government involvement in the economy by structural changes such as reduction in<br>both individual and corporate tax rate, the expensing of depreciable property and<br>government regulation. (Presidential Foundation&amp; Institute). Similar economic reforms were<br>adopted by Margret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and soon spread across the world. This<br>suggests that financialization is positively correlated with encourage of market-led economic<br>mechanisms, this finding corresponds to the FESSUE (Financialisaton Economy Society and<br>Sustainable Development) description of financialization that the process of financialization<br>has been closely interwoven with deregulation of the financial system itself and the economy<br>more generally. (FESSUD 2011, quoted in Sawyer M, 2014) Yingyao Wang(2015), used the<br>empirical case study of China to illustrate the importance of institutional infrastructure in the<br>process of financialization. She argues that the Chinese case of financialization contains three<br>processes: the introduction of shareholder value by the state to manage its assets that leads<br>to an increase in the number of state asset management organisations and the availability of<br>structured investment vehicles to finance fixed asset investments. Duménil and Lévy (2001,<br>quoted in Epstein, 2005) see financialization, neoliberalism and globalization as three deeply<br>related phenomena that mark the current world economy. They argue that neoliberalism is<br>the ‘ideological expression of the reassertion of the power of finance” and that the return of<br>finance to hegemony was “accomplished in close connection with the internationalization of<br>capital and the globalization of markets.” (p.579) Technological innovation accelerates the<br>process of financialization, with the improvement in telecommunication, information could<br>be exchanged in an unprecedented pace. Alongside is the introduction of the computer that<br>enabled quantitative trading, made possible for countless transactions to occur within<br>seconds. There are also cultural effects contribute to financialization, as stated by<br>FESSUD(2011, quoted in Sawyer M, 2014) that: “Consumption has often been sustained by<br>the extension of credit, not least through the use of capital gains in housing as collateral. […]<br>Financialization is associated with a particular culture which is to be interpreted broadly.”<br>Before I make a conclusion of this paragraph, I would like to bring up Malcolm Sawyer(2014)’s<br>point that the term ‘financialization’ is not limited to a specific period or place. The analysis<br>of this essay is focused on the post-80s financialization led by the United State because its<br>degree is unprecedented, and its influence is ever-lasting. The causes of post-80s<br>financialization can be included as 1) Structural change led by neo-liberal principles made by<br>major economic entities such as The United States, The United Kingdom, and The People’s<br>Republic of China. 2) Technological innovation that improves the efficiency of financial<br>transactions vastly. 3) Change in the social environment that made individuals to be more<br>engaged in financial activities. Financialization is the process of these three factors consistently<br>interacting and enhancing each other that shapes society. </p>
<p>The effects of financialization </p>
<p>The impact of financialization is another controversial topic, with scholars including Epstein,<br>Godechot and Andreas Nölke arguing that financialization is fundamentally detrimental to<br>our society, which promotes instability and inequality. Epstein (2005:5) remarked such<br>influence in his book Introduction: Financialization and the World Economy that: “ […] that<br>some effects of financialization – in concert with neoliberalism and globalization – have been<br>highly detrimental to significant numbers of people around the globe.” In terms of inequality,<br>Godechot(2020) addressed inequality fueled by financialization in micro-level between<br>individuals, he argues that financialization has created “a niche with very high wages”. Within<br>those niches, financiers have a “hold up power” over their firms, such power increases the<br>finance wage premium gap and produces a sharp increase in wage inequality. Bruno Bonizzi,<br>Annina Kaltenbrunner and Jeff Powell (2022) analyzed inequality between the countries. They<br>pointed out a ‘subordinate’ state of which developing countries are integrated into the global<br>economy, the US dollar market-based finance and the internationalization of productive<br>capital, altered the geographic transfer of value from subordinate regions to superordinate<br>ones. The hierarchical nature is embedded in global monetary and production relations. In<br>terms of instability, figure 3<br>depicts the frequency of banking crisis by year. There is a period<br>during the 1940s to 1970s, under the Bretton Woods system of which global capital flows<br>were strongly constrained, financial crisis rarely occurred. But since the 1980s, the time point<br>that current financialization began, the financial crisis again became a frequent, clinical event<br>in the world economy.<br><img src="imgs/Image%20three%20financialisation.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>The data clearly shows a transition and its repercussion from a Keynesian-guide Bretton<br>Wood economic system to the neoliberal one, as explained by Magdoff and Paul Sweezy<br>(1987), the expansion of the financial sector and peculiarly debt as a solution to the stagnation<br>that ended the United State’s post WWII economic boom has turned America into a ‘casino<br>society’.<br>Despite the fierce critics, scholars also discovered a strong positive relationship between<br>financial development and economic development. By a sufficient number of empirical<br>studies at both micro and macro levels, Levine (2005) suggests that there is a strong positive<br>link between the functioning of the financial system and long-run economic growth. Both<br>financial intermediaries and markets matter for growth, A well-functioned financial system<br>reduces external financial constraints facing firms, but current theory and evidence are not<br>able to show that financialization is merely an appendage or derivate of economic growth.<br>Later this positive correlation was evaluated by Beck, Degryseb and Kneer (2014), who<br>discovered a U-shaped relationship that shows the benefit of financial development on<br>economic growth only lasts to a certain point, since then the power of the financial sector<br>acts adversely to economic growth. They concluded that: “In the long run financial<br>intermediation increases growth and reduces growth volatility. […]Critically, financial system<br>size, especially non-intermediation service, has a positive relationship with volatility in highincome countries over the medium-term.” (Beck, Degryseb, and Kneer 2014:55) In addition<br>to their argument, Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012) focused on studying the relationship<br>between financial development and economic growth in the medium run among advanced<br>economies. Their data shows the U-shape pattern proposed by Beck, Degryseb and Kneer,<br>and discovered that the intermediation financial services are fundamentally detrimental to<br>productivity growth. Figure 4 shows the average private credit to GDP ratio on the x-axis and<br>average GDP per worker growth on the y-axis, the regression line shows that there is a<br>negative correlation between the two variables after the proportion of average private credit<br>to GDP exceeds 0.3 while the positive correlation between the two variables before that point<br>remains modest. The U-shape is more clearly shown in Figure 5 that the financial<br>intermediation services contribute positively to average GDP per-worker growth within the<br>range of -0.003 to 0.001. And figure 6 shows that there is a linear negative correlation<br>between the growth of average financial intermediation employment and average real GDPper-worker growth. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Financialization is an influential, ongoing process that has branches across various disciplines.<br>This essay has first introduced the methodology to assess the conceptualizations given by<br>different scholars, when conceptualizing, thinkers should first be explicit about their level of<br>analysis, and then be careful about the risks of conceptual dilution and solidification. Based<br>on such methodology, I assessed three popular definitions given by Gerald Epstein, Greta<br>Krippner and Engelbert Stockhammer, they are three distinctive approaches for us to<br>recognize financialization at a macro and meso level. Due to space limitations, the<br>conceptualization of financialization on the micro level is not mentioned. After that, this essay<br>looked into the causes of financialization in the post-80s context, which can be concluded as:<br>“ Initiated by structural change started in the United States and facilitated by technological<br>advancement and changing social culture.” In the last part of this essay, I assessed the effects<br>of financialization with empirical evidence and hard data. Financialization has an adverse<br>impact on medium-run economic growth, injects volatility into society and exacerbates<br>inequality with rich counties and individuals being even wealthier and the poor getting worse.<br>However, there is also a strong positive correlation between financial development and longrun economic growth. Given that the causality between the correlation is yet clear, it is<br>possible that these repercussions of financialization could be primarily caused by other<br>external factors and financialization just works as a catalyst.</p>

          <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>At the end of 2022, a series of unprecedented protests against strict COVID-19 policy took<br>place in the People’s Republic of China. These protests are known as the White Paper Protests<br>or A4 Revolution. (白纸革命/A4 革命) The White Paper Protests were triggered by the 2022<br>Ürümqi fire and started at the Communication University of China, Nanjing (CUCN). Students<br>in CUCN organised spontaneously to pay tribute to victims in Ürümqi by holding White A4<br>papers that symbolises the censorship by the official government to prevent its people from<br>attaining such information. The protests quickly spread across the country and transformed<br>into a large civil movement to show people’s exhaustion about the brutal Zero-covid policy.<br>In this essay, I will use narrative analysis to show the dynamics of political mobilisation and<br>protest by demonstrating how sorrowful narratives related to China’s covid policy enabled<br>such a nationwide demonstration that is rare and almost impossible to organize under the<br>absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party. This essay is divided into two parts and adopts<br>the approach to narrative analysis by Francesca Polletta (2006 p166-167), who suggests<br>identifying two things: a) the feature of narrative that allows it to achieve certain rhetorical<br>effects, b) the social conditions in which those rhetorical effects are likely to be politically<br>consequential. </p>
<p><strong>The features of narratives in the White Paper Protests</strong> </p>
<p>Ürümqi is the capital city of Xinjiang province, the home of the Uyghur people. There was a<br>few cases of covid spread in Xinjiang since August 2022, the local government followed the<br>‘Zero-covid’ policy and adopted hostile means such as lockdowns and mandatory testing to<br>prevent the spreading of the epidemic. (ABC News, 2022) When the fire broke out in the<br>Jixiangyuan community, the fire engines could not approach the building as a crucial rescue<br>passageway was blocked by bollards for traffic control (Wang and Liu, 2022) and other roads<br>were blocked by cars that could not move because their batteries were dead from having not<br>been used for too long due to the lockdown. (Che and Chien, 2022) As a result, it took three<br>hours and a half to extinguish the fire and ten cases of death were reported, including a threeyear-old child. (Hoshur, 2022)<br>The fire in Ürümqi was not an isolated tragedy that relates to China’s hostile Zero-covid policy.<br>Two months prior to the Ürümqi fire, on the eighteenth of September, a bus in Guizhou<br>province that carried 47 passengers crashed on its way to a quarantine facility, resulted over<br>half of the passengers’ death. Under China’s Zero-covid policy, only a few positive cases of<br>covid could inform large-scale lockdowns and virus tests. After the accident, the government<br>official was ambiguous about the reason that causes the passengers to quarantine, the only<br>explanation was that they are “epidemic-related”. It is unclear to us whether they were tested<br>positive for the virus or had contact with those positive patients. Emotional comments on the<br>internet that expresses their outrage about the accident were removed by censors, and some<br>of the users’ accounts were abandoned (Wang and Dong 2022).<br>Earlier in the same year, serval pregnant women that were about to labour were rejected for<br>immediate medical care because their reports of a negative covid test exceeded four hours.<br>A picture of a bleeding pregnant woman sitting in front of the gate of the hospital went viral<br>on the internet, the baby died after she finally got to enter the hospital three hours later (BBC<br>News, 2022). Again, comments about the event were censored.<br>There are four common features in these tragedies: i) Unnecessary irreversible body damage<br>ii) Directly and indirectly related to the Zero-covid policy iii) Completely random and<br>unpredictable. Iv) Comments about these events that do not follow mainstream state media<br>will be censored These features echo Polltta’s (2006) proposition of qualities required for<br>stories to own rhetorical force, which are a) Eliciting an emotional identification with the<br>stories’ protagonists, b) Enable people to identify with experiences that are very far from their<br>own. The two conditions must be fulfilled simultaneously in order to produce sympathetic<br>understanding that leads to effecting changes. If only a) was fulfilled, then there is a possibility<br>that we may identify emotionally with a story but do not feel the necessity to do anything to<br>make a difference, and vice versa for the condition where only b) was fulfilled.<br>The shocking picture of the pregnant woman bleeding in front of the hospital is emotionally<br>strong enough to call for sympathy from whoever sees it while almost all citizens in China<br>experienced at least once of sudden lockdown due to positive covid cases that appears from<br>nowhere and they have all more or less suffered from the practical as well as emotional<br>disruption of lockdown. Thus, the narratives created a sense of “this could also happen to me<br>and my family, and I am even not allowed to talk about it.” Such humiliation of civil rights<br>evokes the people of China to go onto the streets to finish the endless miserable Zero-covid<br>policy by waving white A4 papers to address the elephant in the room. </p>
<p><strong>Social conditions that enabled the White Paper Protests</strong> </p>
<p>There are three social conditions that built the foundation of White Paper Protests: i) the<br>appearance of the Coronavirus Omicron variant, ii) the development of effective vaccines iii)<br>The economic hardship as a repercussion of the Zero-covid policy.<br>When the epidemic first began in late 2019, the virus remained mysterious to the public. All<br>we knew was that it is a highly contaminating disease and 14% of the infected have server<br>complications including breathlessness and pneumonia. (Dehkordi et al 2020 p868) The<br>lockdown policy was proven to be an effective measure to control the spreading of such<br>devastating virus and was adopted by not only China but also Italy, Spain and the United<br>Kingdom. (Dehkordi et al. 2020) (Brown et al. 2021) Due to quick response, China controlled<br>the epidemic and its economic activities recovered within 3 months. As a result, China was<br>the only main economy that achieved a positive GDP growth rate of 2.2% in 2020 by<br>comparison of -11% in the United Kingdom, -2.8% in the United States and -4.5% in Japan.<br>(World Bank 2022)<br>However, the appearance of Omicron, a much more infectious and less dangerous variant<br>(McMahan, 2022) and the development of vaccines turned the covid virus into a manageable<br>disease for individuals. China’s strict means to eliminate the virus were becoming less effective<br>when facing Omicron and individuals are exhausted with frequent PCR tests and sudden<br>lockdowns. In other words, what people are afraid of since Omicron is not having serious<br>symptoms from Omicron, but the mandatory quarantine and inconvenience brought by the<br>Zero-covid policy itself. Economically, the service sector suffered particularly from the Zerocovid policy. On the one hand, people were going out less due to fear of having contact with<br>the covid; on the other hand, restaurants, hotels, and nightclubs could be forced to close for<br>months if there is one covid case. As a result, China’s non-manufactory business activity index<br>fell by 2% by December 2022 (National Development and Reform Commission, 2022). The<br>manufactory industry was also hit hard by the Zero-Covid policy. Toyota announced a<br>statement to cut production of approximately 50,000 units in 2022 due to the impact of the<br>lockdown in Shanghai. (Toyota, 2022) Later after the announcement, Toyota’s company<br>shares fall by 4.5% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Hoskins, 2022). Which raises political<br>concerns for foreign investors to expand their factories in China. As the data informs, China’s<br>Zero-Covid was becoming increasingly unnecessary and resulting in huge damage to socialeconomical life. But there is a ratchet effect on the Chinese government to not alter its policy<br>due to prior propaganda on its earlier success. As there is no sign when this miserable policy<br>will end, people with no choices, had to go onto the streets, waving ironic white papers to<br>express their dissatisfaction about the zero-covid policy and call for changes. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p>This essay analyses how woeful narratives ignited people’s fire to conduct White Paper Protest<br>under great risk of being arrested by the government in order to call for an end to the<br>miserable Zero-Covid policy. Firstly, the narratives in China reached magnificent rhetorical<br>effect by possessing features of unpredictable secondary disasters caused by the Zero-covid<br>policy but not by the coronavirus itself, for which individuals could identify emotional<br>connection between the protagonists’ tragedy with similarities of their own experiences.<br>Secondly, the fact that the virus was much more transmissible and less dangerous combined<br>with the development of effective vaccines gave the people good reasons to stop the policy<br>that brought them considerable economic burdens. To conclude, we can discover from the<br>case of the White Paper Protest that the power of narratives is irresistible, despite a strict<br>censorship system, the narratives could still gather people together on protests, it is able to<br>turn its greatest enemy of censorship system into protesters’ weapon as a metaphoric white<br>paper to against this very system</p>

<p>The article had introduced us the new Reiwa era of Japan, starting from the challenges it was facing from the outbreak of coronavirus to the resign of Abel. Yet the author says that the state of Japan is not that bad, we had been exaggerated both the success of Japan during the Showa era and the failure of Heise era as known as “the lost decade.”We must switch out view towards Japan from being a ever-fast-growing society that always seeks economic growth into a mature, developed economy that pursues other things such as diversity, resilience and sustainability. </p>

<p>This article started with the failure of an auction happened in Liuzhou to sell parcels of land. It then introduced us LGFV, an odd concoction of semi-public and semi-private bond which served as the cornerstone of China’s rapid growth. It built a system that the government lease this bond to build infrastructures and pay them with land-scale revenue. It then implicitly suggested that this system has huge risk with the fact of the bankruptcy of 恒大. There might be undermining economic issues caused by this kind of shadow loan worth that worth half of the GDP of China because the earnings from the infrastructures it built is insufficient to payback it and the ability for local-governments to earn from land-scale revenue is falling. </p>

<p>It is surprising that Tokyo rated the first in the liveability index of the Economist Intelligence Unit as a mega city. The population it holds is more than the sum of the other top five cities. It can be a paradigm for governments and city planners because it showed that the size of the city does not necessarily affect it liveability. Tokyo’s success is based on the “success” and “failure” in the past. The “success” part is the government’s determination of build advanced public transportation to connect the city, which helped Tokyo polycentric with many hubs. However, because it was growing too fast in the past, government’s plan of zoning the city with different function of “this is the living area, this is the shopping area.”failed, but as time goes by such mixed, mess areas seems to work very well, residents are more aware of the 1 mile around them which make the community strong. There are also problem of declining population in the future, but scientists believe that it will be less a issue with the help of big data. </p>
<p>High risk investing - Business Daily <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct1j18">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct1j18</a></p>
<p>The Indian stock market had went into a bull market due to the influence of lockdown and the rise of technology such as online trading platforms that allow small-scale investors with humble background to involve in the market. Young people aged among 18-25 are the majority of the new investors entered to the market, mostly because the lockdown cut the opportunity to spend their money. A concern over it is that it might be a bubble because young people are usually more engaged to high risk investing, especially crypto  currencies, with hope to have magnificent return. However, most of them have little tolerance to failure. Some specialists argue that it is the norm for youngsters to take high risks because they have “little to lose”, and this might inject energy to the market as long as they are cautious about the failure. Another concern over the recent stock market is that data shows more and more people are checking their investments frequently, this suggests that there is a trend for short-term gambling instead of long-term invest. </p>

          <p>(It is the notes I made for the open class of professor Shelly of philosophy in Yale) </p>
<p>Is there any chance that we can still survive after we died? </p>
<p>The objection sounds quite obvious and easy to understand. By the definition of death means the end of life, it is just like asking what happens after the end of a movie? Can we still eat the food when all the food on the plate has been eaten? </p>
<p>The term “survives”, and “death” cannot appear at the same time, there is an old classic joke says: “ If a plane exactly on the border of America and Canada, where do you bury the survivors?” The answer is, we don’t bury the survivors  </p>
<p>But these objections typically refer to the body death, to make the question precise, we shall ask: “ Do I still exist after my body died?” To answer this question, we must figure out what am I? What kind of thing is a person and what does it mean for it to die?” </p>
<p>There are two main positions of this question. One thinks that a person is a combination of a body and something else – the mind, or shall I call it, the soul. An immaterial substance. it is a metaphysical substance and must be understood in nonphysical terms. It is the dualist view.</p>
<p>The other view thinks that a person is just a certain kind of material object that can do some amazing things other objects cannot. It is the physicalist view. </p>
<p>Death to the first position means the severing of the super tight connection between the body and the soul. </p>
<p>In this point of view, there is a chance that we could still exist after the death of our body, or maybe not because body and soul, they work in pairs, if the pair no longer exist (one part of the pair died) then person no longer exists. </p>
<p>So here brings the first question in this point of view: Are soul and body distinct? Followed by this question we can continue to ask: Can the soul survive the destruction of the body? (Maybe the body can bring the soul away when it dies as they interact tightly) If it can, for how long?  </p>

          <p>(This is an answer of mine on Zhihu知乎, it is a Q&amp;A community like Quora. I added some extra explanation for the English version because some common sense only exists in certain geographical areas) </p>
<p>Question: How do you view China’s overall economic data in July 2021 missing market expectations?</p>
<p>Data: China’s July Surveyed Urban Unemployment Rate: last value: 5%;Market expectation: 5%;Published value: 5.1%</p>
<p>The annual rate of Industrial Production above Designated Size in China in July: last: 8.3%; Market expectations: 7.8%; Published value: 6.4%</p>
<p>China’s Urban Fixed Asset Investment annualized January-July: Last value: 12.6%;Market expectations: 11.3%;Published value: 10.3%</p>
<p>July Retail Sales y/Y: Last value: 12.1%;Market expectations: 11.5%;Published value: 8.5%</p>
<p>According to the Report on the Work of the Government in 2021, the main development target for this year is to increase GDP by at least 6 per cent. Over 11 million new urban jobs will be created, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate will be around 5.5 per cent. Raise the CPI by around 3%. The quality of imports and exports increased steadily, and the balance of payments was balanced. Cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by about 3%; Grain output was kept above 500,000,000 tons</p>
<p>Answer: </p>
<p>I want to say something different than the general pessimistic tone of many economists in this community. </p>
<p>First, it is a hard thing for China to achieve an acceptable economic growth figure in such an awful global economic environment nowadays and it is reasonable that it missed its target, we should not worry too much about it. </p>
<p>However, the problem of weak consumption is an elephant in the room that we can not ignore it by the excuse of the bad international environment. Just like Deng XiaoPing (The second leader of CCP after Mao ZeDong, introduced the market mechanism to China) described:” There is the international big climate, and we have our own domestic small climate.” </p>
<p>We can see that dark clouds are appearing in the domestic small climate. I think other writers on this topic had clearly addressed the cause of it: The uncertainty brought by the capricious COVID pandemic, the forbidding price of housing and health care. </p>
<p>For the first cause, I think our party did a satisfactory job, the domestic pandemic is still under control and vaccination is happening orderly.</p>
<p>The housing price problem is a noticeable one, there could be a catastrophe if this problem is handled in the wrong way. Debt deflation is very likely to happen if the price was cut because housing is the most important asset that most of the households in China own and the debt related to it is magnificent. Falling house prices will lead to a decline in people’s assets, which in turn leads to a de facto appreciation of debt, then leads to less consumption, which in turn results in a further decline in housing prices. Things would be terrible than we could imagine if this process takes place. </p>
<p>This is my observation of the housing market of China: I was raised in Shanghai, the most developed city in China with the highest housing price. Even though houses are far more expensive here than in other cities, the consumption is prosperous in Shanghai, In the main scenic spots around Jiangsu and Zhejiang(Shanghai’s neighbour provinces), the majority of tourists in regular days are Shanghainese. This is the case because Shanghai has the highest average wages in China and indigenous people have their own houses there. The high housing price is ruthlessly exploiting labours from other provinces, they come to Shanghai for better job and higher wages, but they have to pass most of their income to the landlord who is most of the time the indigenous people. There is a popular sentence here: “The money you earn in Shanghai stays in Shanghai.”</p>
<p>When introducing the free market to China, the great leader Deng XiaoPing said: “The ones who become wealthy first then help others become wealthy.” Things are not happening like that nowadays. I think local governments should be trying to create quality jobs in the area to keep the young people, to keep the labour force, and the Shanghai government should be doing something for them, helping them, so that they can send their money earned in Shanghai back home to build their hometown rather than just driving them away by strict policies. Working people are lovely, they built Shanghai, they are not a flood beast.</p>
<p>Anyway, problems exist, but there are always more solutions than problems. </p>
<p>The third cause, hospitals, (social health care is basically a black box, we have it, but nobody actually knows how it works, what we do know is that serious illness can easily take the whole fortune of a family away. Crowdfunding in China is mostly for families to raise money for medical treatment), it is an old problem. On the one hand, it stops people from spending their income, on the other hand, it encourages them to work harder and produce more. Because. “I need to save money for the time I am too old to work.” Excessive supply always exists in China, in the past, we could sell it to the rest of the world in the past, but it is hard to do that now as the world is in a recession. I believe the government have the ability to fix this issue by increasing government spending on social benefits. </p>
<p>This is on the microeconomic level, on a macroeconomic level, central banks still have some cards to play: interest rates still have a way to go, quantitative easing is also a powerful weapon because China is a huge sovereign state that has productivity and credits.</p>
<p>So, please be optimistic. </p>
<p>PS: there is one worrying issue – the sluggish political reformation. Ten years ago, in a speech in Shenzhen(深圳), the premier Wen Jiabao at the time said:” Without the Guarantee of Political System Reform, the Successes of Restructuring the Economic System Will Be Lost and the Goal of Modernization Cannot Be Realized.”</p>

          <p>We can consider this chapter as preparation for Hayek’s further expound, he pointed out that many terms that were commonly used was ambiguous and he clarified what they actually mean, this is necessary because a strong logic system cannot be built on vague definitions. </p>
<p>Firstly, Hayek broke up the purpose and means from the definition of socialism, he said that he is not criticizing the purpose of socialism of achieving Plato’s Utopia, but the means of “planning” of socialism as a specie of collectivism. </p>
<p>“and all the consequences with which we shall be concerned in this book follow from the methods of collectivism irrespective of the ends for which they are used.” </p>
<p>Next, Hayek clarified the meaning of “planning” in general and narrow mean. Generally, to plan means to take decisions rationally, “we should handle our common problems as rationally as possible and that, in so doing, we should use as much foresight as we can command. In this sense everybody who is not a complete fatalist is a planner, every political act is (or ought to be) an act of planning, and there can be differences only between good and bad, between wise and foresighted and foolish and shortsighted planning.” And that is what we are doing every day. Narrowly, planning is a method, means to control society and manage resources consciously. That is what socialisms try to do. </p>
<p>“What our planners demand is a central direction of all economic activity according to a single plan, laying down how the resources of society should be “consciously directed” to serve particular ends in a definite way.”</p>
<p>To be clear in my following composition, I will use “plan” to represent its general meaning and “planning” for its narrow meaning. </p>
<p>After made definitions clear and explained how socialism want to achieve their goal Hayek emphasized that we should not simply put the ideas against planning as the attitude of Laissez-faire. He described how liberalism use competition to allocate resources efficiently, “It is based on the conviction that, where effective competition can be created, it is a better way of guiding individual efforts than any other.” The point here is to create effective competition.</p>
<p>I put the whole discussion here because they are easy to understand even as a single paragraph. </p>
<p>“It does not deny, but even emphasizes, that, so that competition should work beneficially, a carefully thought-out legal framework is required and that neither the existing nor the past legal rules are free from grave defects. Nor does it deny that, where it is impossible to create the conditions necessary to make competition effective, we must resort to other methods of guiding economic activity. Economic liberalism is opposed, however, to competition’s being supplanted by inferior methods of coordinating individual efforts. And it regards competition as superior not only because it is in most circumstances the most efficient method known but even more because it is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority. Indeed, one of the main arguments in favor of competition is that it dispenses with the need for “conscious social control” and that it gives the individuals a chance to decide whether the prospects of a particular occupation are sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages and risks connected with it.”</p>
<p>In the last quote Hayek introduced the method that liberalisms use and why it is superior to planning, he also mentioned the disadvantages of competition. That is the market failure that every economic student will study such as under proving of public goods, externalities and asymmetric information. The government have to intervene when market failure happens, but that cannot be the argument that competition is inefficient and should be suppressed.</p>
<p>“To create conditions in which competition will be as effective as possible, to supplement it where it cannot be made effective.”   </p>
<p>At the end of this chapter, Hayek described the process of UK at the time was experiencing was and why planning and competition cannot coexist. There will be a terrible situation when left and right wings united together because of the hatred towards competition but have no consensus on other things. “a state of affairs which can satisfy neither planners nor liberals: a sort of syndicalist or “corporative” organization of industry, in which competition is more or less suppressed but planning is left in the hands of the independent monopolies of the separate industries.”</p>
<p>I must do a conclusion here or I will copy the whole book and this article will lose its meaning. Narrowly, planning and competition cannot coexist because a person cannot be healthy and unhealthy at the same time. Generally, they only work together when it is “plan for competition” instead of “plan for not compete.” </p>

          <p>“The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living”. (Karl Marx, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte). In the first chapter, the Abandoned Road Hayek said a similar thing to Marx that: “That a change of ideas and the force of human will have made the world what it is now.” In a certain way this line told us the purpose why Hayek wrote this book, to prevent the horrible future from happening by awakening people’s mind and perception about it now.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Hayek firstly did a short conclusion of the history of ideas of Europe: “But the essential features of that individualism which, from elements provided by Christianity and the philosophy of classical antiquity, was first fully developed during the Renaissance and has since grown and spread into what we know as Western civilization—are the respect for the individual man qua man, that is, the recognition of his own views and tastes as supreme in his own sphere.”</p>
<p>I think it is necessary for me to introduce a principle of economic study here in case you are not familiar with it. It is called “rational decision”, which means individuals tend to maximize their interests from every economic decision they make, the integration of millions of decisions made by millions of people will result in economic growth and a better future. It is easy to tell how much this principle fits the idea of individualism and liberalism. Where does economic growth come from if you don’t even have the freedom and right to make the decision? </p>
<p>It was 1944 when this book was firstly published, The UK was at the end of the miserable WWII. After experiencing two times of world war and serious economic depression. Scholars began to reflect on whether the liberal constitutionalism brought that made Europe progressive and wealthy was still an effective method of social management nowadays, they started to consider that socialism was the better alternative. </p>
<p>Hayek believed that the reason for the left-wing ideological trend was because the progress brought about by the principle of individualism had become a norm, the relatively slow pace of progress was no longer satisfied by people, and people began to see the principle as an obstacle that urgently needed to be removed. “It might even be said that the very success of liberalism became the cause of its decline.”</p>
<p>In this chapter Hayek also mentioned why laissez faire is detrimental and the duty of governments in a free market. He will talk more about it in the following chapters.  </p>

          <p>In this chapter Hayek mentioned the forceful propaganda weapon socialisms use which is the promise of “new freedom” – “the great existing disparities in the range of choice of different people were to disappear.” This promise is so attractive that more and more liberalisms were seduced to the road to serfdom because they could not recognise the conflict between the principle of socialism and liberalism. </p>
<p>The expound of such conflict is the motif throughout the book, this chapter is focused on the observation of the striking similarities between the current socialism and authoritarian counties – Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union under the rule of Stalin </p>
<p>In this chapter, he quoted lines from Max Eastman: “Max Eastman, Lenin’s old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that “instead of being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism, more ruthless, barbarous, unjust, immoral, antidemocratic, unredeemed by any hope or scruple,” and that it is “better described as superfascist”; and when we find the same author recognizing that “Stalinism is socialism, in the sense of being an inevitable although unforeseen political accompaniment of the nationalization and collectivization which he had relied upon as part of his plan for erecting a classless society,”</p>
<p>Hayek thought that Fascism and Socialism were just like two denominations of one big religion, ruthlessly kill each other but adore the same lord above.</p>
<p>“No less significant is the intellectual history of many of the Nazi and Fascist leaders. Everyone who has watched the growth of these movements in Italy10 or in Germany has been struck by the number of leading men, from Mussolini downward (and not excluding Laval and Quisling), who began as socialists and ended as Fascists or Nazis.” </p>
<p>“It is true, of course, that in Germany before 1933, and in Italy before 1922, communists and Nazis or Fascists clashed more frequently with each other than with other parties. They competed for the support of the same type of mind and reserved for each other the hatred of the heretic. But their practice showed how closely they are related. To both, the real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in common and whom they could not hope to convince, is the liberal of the old type.” </p>
<p>In this chapter Hayek also quoted comments of scholars from different backgrounds to support his opinion towards socialism. </p>

          <p>Nowadays it is common sense that Friedrich August Von Hayek is a great economist and his masterpiece The Road to Serfdom is on the must-read list of every student study economic, politics and sociology. </p>
<p>However, this is not the case when this book was firstly published in 1944. After the trauma of two times of world war and huge economic turmoil, people began to question classical liberalism and to treat socialism as a better alternative. Left-wing ideas were the mainstream, among such current of thought Hayek stood out and appealed:” Do not go the road of the command economy, that’s a road of serfdom!” We can imagine how much criticisms were there on him. </p>
<p>Events that happened in the 20th century approved Hayek’s thoughts, especially after the new phenomenon of stagflation when inflation and economic recession occurred spontaneously after the 1973 oil crisis. Hayek’s liberalism and Milton Freedman’s monetarism were revalued and become the principle of the Reagan and Thatcher government; they brought a golden age of economic growth. </p>
<p>Nowadays the collapse of the Soviet Union and the miracle of China’s economic growth after it introduced free-market again supported Hayek. What is the magic of Hayek? How did he reemphasise and reform classical liberalism? </p>
<p>I think there are some important points that he made. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The free-market economy is the most efficient and ideal allocation system that human beings could find so far. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The economic freedom is the foundation of political freedom.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Freedom is only possible under the rule by law</p>
</li>
<li><p>Laws are telos(purpose), not means. Governments should OBEY the law to govern the society instead of USE the law.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Laissez faire is detrimental.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Democracy is merely a means to realize the liberty of individuals and stability of the society, it is not the telos. </p>
</li>
</ol>
