<p>The article had introduced us the new Reiwa era of Japan, starting from the challenges it was facing from the outbreak of coronavirus to the resign of Abel. Yet the author says that the state of Japan is not that bad, we had been exaggerated both the success of Japan during the Showa era and the failure of Heise era as known as “the lost decade.”We must switch out view towards Japan from being a ever-fast-growing society that always seeks economic growth into a mature, developed economy that pursues other things such as diversity, resilience and sustainability. </p>
<p>China’s property slowdown sheds light on another worrying debt problem <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/chinas-property-slowdown-sheds-light-on-another-worrying-debt-problem/21806824">https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/chinas-property-slowdown-sheds-light-on-another-worrying-debt-problem/21806824</a></p>
<p>This article started with the failure of an auction happened in Liuzhou to sell parcels of land. It then introduced us LGFV, an odd concoction of semi-public and semi-private bond which served as the cornerstone of China’s rapid growth. It built a system that the government lease this bond to build infrastructures and pay them with land-scale revenue. It then implicitly suggested that this system has huge risk with the fact of the bankruptcy of 恒大. There might be undermining economic issues caused by this kind of shadow loan worth that worth half of the GDP of China because the earnings from the infrastructures it built is insufficient to payback it and the ability for local-governments to earn from land-scale revenue is falling. </p>
<p>The big city that is also pleasant to live in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/the-big-city-that-is-also-pleasant-to-live-in">https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/the-big-city-that-is-also-pleasant-to-live-in</a></p>
<p>It is surprising that Tokyo rated the first in the liveability index of the Economist Intelligence Unit as a mega city. The population it holds is more than the sum of the other top five cities. It can be a paradigm for governments and city planners because it showed that the size of the city does not necessarily affect it liveability. Tokyo’s success is based on the “success” and “failure” in the past. The “success” part is the government’s determination of build advanced public transportation to connect the city, which helped Tokyo polycentric with many hubs. However, because it was growing too fast in the past, government’s plan of zoning the city with different function of “this is the living area, this is the shopping area.”failed, but as time goes by such mixed, mess areas seems to work very well, residents are more aware of the 1 mile around them which make the community strong. There are also problem of declining population in the future, but scientists believe that it will be less a issue with the help of big data. </p>
<p>High risk investing - Business Daily <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct1j18">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct1j18</a></p>
<p>The Indian stock market had went into a bull market due to the influence of lockdown and the rise of technology such as online trading platforms that allow small-scale investors with humble background to involve in the market. Young people aged among 18-25 are the majority of the new investors entered to the market, mostly because the lockdown cut the opportunity to spend their money. A concern over it is that it might be a bubble because young people are usually more engaged to high risk investing, especially crypto  currencies, with hope to have magnificent return. However, most of them have little tolerance to failure. Some specialists argue that it is the norm for youngsters to take high risks because they have “little to lose”, and this might inject energy to the market as long as they are cautious about the failure. Another concern over the recent stock market is that data shows more and more people are checking their investments frequently, this suggests that there is a trend for short-term gambling instead of long-term invest. </p>

          <p>(It is the notes I made for the open class of professor Shelly of philosophy in Yale) </p>
<p>Is there any chance that we can still survive after we died? </p>
<p>The objection sounds quite obvious and easy to understand. By the definition of death means the end of life, it is just like asking what happens after the end of a movie? Can we still eat the food when all the food on the plate has been eaten? </p>
<p>The term “survives”, and “death” cannot appear at the same time, there is an old classic joke says: “ If a plane exactly on the border of America and Canada, where do you bury the survivors?” The answer is, we don’t bury the survivors  </p>
<p>But these objections typically refer to the body death, to make the question precise, we shall ask: “ Do I still exist after my body died?” To answer this question, we must figure out what am I? What kind of thing is a person and what does it mean for it to die?” </p>
<p>There are two main positions of this question. One thinks that a person is a combination of a body and something else – the mind, or shall I call it, the soul. An immaterial substance. it is a metaphysical substance and must be understood in nonphysical terms. It is the dualist view.</p>
<p>The other view thinks that a person is just a certain kind of material object that can do some amazing things other objects cannot. It is the physicalist view. </p>
<p>Death to the first position means the severing of the super tight connection between the body and the soul. </p>
<p>In this point of view, there is a chance that we could still exist after the death of our body, or maybe not because body and soul, they work in pairs, if the pair no longer exist (one part of the pair died) then person no longer exists. </p>
<p>So here brings the first question in this point of view: Are soul and body distinct? Followed by this question we can continue to ask: Can the soul survive the destruction of the body? (Maybe the body can bring the soul away when it dies as they interact tightly) If it can, for how long?  </p>

          <p>(This is an answer of mine on Zhihu知乎, it is a Q&amp;A community like Quora. I added some extra explanation for the English version because some common sense only exists in certain geographical areas) </p>
<p>Question: How do you view China’s overall economic data in July 2021 missing market expectations?</p>
<p>Data: China’s July Surveyed Urban Unemployment Rate: last value: 5%;Market expectation: 5%;Published value: 5.1%</p>
<p>The annual rate of Industrial Production above Designated Size in China in July: last: 8.3%; Market expectations: 7.8%; Published value: 6.4%</p>
<p>China’s Urban Fixed Asset Investment annualized January-July: Last value: 12.6%;Market expectations: 11.3%;Published value: 10.3%</p>
<p>July Retail Sales y/Y: Last value: 12.1%;Market expectations: 11.5%;Published value: 8.5%</p>
<p>According to the Report on the Work of the Government in 2021, the main development target for this year is to increase GDP by at least 6 per cent. Over 11 million new urban jobs will be created, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate will be around 5.5 per cent. Raise the CPI by around 3%. The quality of imports and exports increased steadily, and the balance of payments was balanced. Cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by about 3%; Grain output was kept above 500,000,000 tons</p>
<p>Answer: </p>
<p>I want to say something different than the general pessimistic tone of many economists in this community. </p>
<p>First, it is a hard thing for China to achieve an acceptable economic growth figure in such an awful global economic environment nowadays and it is reasonable that it missed its target, we should not worry too much about it. </p>
<p>However, the problem of weak consumption is an elephant in the room that we can not ignore it by the excuse of the bad international environment. Just like Deng XiaoPing (The second leader of CCP after Mao ZeDong, introduced the market mechanism to China) described:” There is the international big climate, and we have our own domestic small climate.” </p>
<p>We can see that dark clouds are appearing in the domestic small climate. I think other writers on this topic had clearly addressed the cause of it: The uncertainty brought by the capricious COVID pandemic, the forbidding price of housing and health care. </p>
<p>For the first cause, I think our party did a satisfactory job, the domestic pandemic is still under control and vaccination is happening orderly.</p>
<p>The housing price problem is a noticeable one, there could be a catastrophe if this problem is handled in the wrong way. Debt deflation is very likely to happen if the price was cut because housing is the most important asset that most of the households in China own and the debt related to it is magnificent. Falling house prices will lead to a decline in people’s assets, which in turn leads to a de facto appreciation of debt, then leads to less consumption, which in turn results in a further decline in housing prices. Things would be terrible than we could imagine if this process takes place. </p>
<p>This is my observation of the housing market of China: I was raised in Shanghai, the most developed city in China with the highest housing price. Even though houses are far more expensive here than in other cities, the consumption is prosperous in Shanghai, In the main scenic spots around Jiangsu and Zhejiang(Shanghai’s neighbour provinces), the majority of tourists in regular days are Shanghainese. This is the case because Shanghai has the highest average wages in China and indigenous people have their own houses there. The high housing price is ruthlessly exploiting labours from other provinces, they come to Shanghai for better job and higher wages, but they have to pass most of their income to the landlord who is most of the time the indigenous people. There is a popular sentence here: “The money you earn in Shanghai stays in Shanghai.”</p>
<p>When introducing the free market to China, the great leader Deng XiaoPing said: “The ones who become wealthy first then help others become wealthy.” Things are not happening like that nowadays. I think local governments should be trying to create quality jobs in the area to keep the young people, to keep the labour force, and the Shanghai government should be doing something for them, helping them, so that they can send their money earned in Shanghai back home to build their hometown rather than just driving them away by strict policies. Working people are lovely, they built Shanghai, they are not a flood beast.</p>
<p>Anyway, problems exist, but there are always more solutions than problems. </p>
<p>The third cause, hospitals, (social health care is basically a black box, we have it, but nobody actually knows how it works, what we do know is that serious illness can easily take the whole fortune of a family away. Crowdfunding in China is mostly for families to raise money for medical treatment), it is an old problem. On the one hand, it stops people from spending their income, on the other hand, it encourages them to work harder and produce more. Because. “I need to save money for the time I am too old to work.” Excessive supply always exists in China, in the past, we could sell it to the rest of the world in the past, but it is hard to do that now as the world is in a recession. I believe the government have the ability to fix this issue by increasing government spending on social benefits. </p>
<p>This is on the microeconomic level, on a macroeconomic level, central banks still have some cards to play: interest rates still have a way to go, quantitative easing is also a powerful weapon because China is a huge sovereign state that has productivity and credits.</p>
<p>So, please be optimistic. </p>
<p>PS: there is one worrying issue – the sluggish political reformation. Ten years ago, in a speech in Shenzhen(深圳), the premier Wen Jiabao at the time said:” Without the Guarantee of Political System Reform, the Successes of Restructuring the Economic System Will Be Lost and the Goal of Modernization Cannot Be Realized.”</p>

          <p>We can consider this chapter as preparation for Hayek’s further expound, he pointed out that many terms that were commonly used was ambiguous and he clarified what they actually mean, this is necessary because a strong logic system cannot be built on vague definitions. </p>
<p>Firstly, Hayek broke up the purpose and means from the definition of socialism, he said that he is not criticizing the purpose of socialism of achieving Plato’s Utopia, but the means of “planning” of socialism as a specie of collectivism. </p>
<p>“and all the consequences with which we shall be concerned in this book follow from the methods of collectivism irrespective of the ends for which they are used.” </p>
<p>Next, Hayek clarified the meaning of “planning” in general and narrow mean. Generally, to plan means to take decisions rationally, “we should handle our common problems as rationally as possible and that, in so doing, we should use as much foresight as we can command. In this sense everybody who is not a complete fatalist is a planner, every political act is (or ought to be) an act of planning, and there can be differences only between good and bad, between wise and foresighted and foolish and shortsighted planning.” And that is what we are doing every day. Narrowly, planning is a method, means to control society and manage resources consciously. That is what socialisms try to do. </p>
<p>“What our planners demand is a central direction of all economic activity according to a single plan, laying down how the resources of society should be “consciously directed” to serve particular ends in a definite way.”</p>
<p>To be clear in my following composition, I will use “plan” to represent its general meaning and “planning” for its narrow meaning. </p>
<p>After made definitions clear and explained how socialism want to achieve their goal Hayek emphasized that we should not simply put the ideas against planning as the attitude of Laissez-faire. He described how liberalism use competition to allocate resources efficiently, “It is based on the conviction that, where effective competition can be created, it is a better way of guiding individual efforts than any other.” The point here is to create effective competition.</p>
<p>I put the whole discussion here because they are easy to understand even as a single paragraph. </p>
<p>“It does not deny, but even emphasizes, that, so that competition should work beneficially, a carefully thought-out legal framework is required and that neither the existing nor the past legal rules are free from grave defects. Nor does it deny that, where it is impossible to create the conditions necessary to make competition effective, we must resort to other methods of guiding economic activity. Economic liberalism is opposed, however, to competition’s being supplanted by inferior methods of coordinating individual efforts. And it regards competition as superior not only because it is in most circumstances the most efficient method known but even more because it is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority. Indeed, one of the main arguments in favor of competition is that it dispenses with the need for “conscious social control” and that it gives the individuals a chance to decide whether the prospects of a particular occupation are sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages and risks connected with it.”</p>
<p>In the last quote Hayek introduced the method that liberalisms use and why it is superior to planning, he also mentioned the disadvantages of competition. That is the market failure that every economic student will study such as under proving of public goods, externalities and asymmetric information. The government have to intervene when market failure happens, but that cannot be the argument that competition is inefficient and should be suppressed.</p>
<p>“To create conditions in which competition will be as effective as possible, to supplement it where it cannot be made effective.”   </p>
<p>At the end of this chapter, Hayek described the process of UK at the time was experiencing was and why planning and competition cannot coexist. There will be a terrible situation when left and right wings united together because of the hatred towards competition but have no consensus on other things. “a state of affairs which can satisfy neither planners nor liberals: a sort of syndicalist or “corporative” organization of industry, in which competition is more or less suppressed but planning is left in the hands of the independent monopolies of the separate industries.”</p>
<p>I must do a conclusion here or I will copy the whole book and this article will lose its meaning. Narrowly, planning and competition cannot coexist because a person cannot be healthy and unhealthy at the same time. Generally, they only work together when it is “plan for competition” instead of “plan for not compete.” </p>

          <p>“The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living”. (Karl Marx, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte). In the first chapter, the Abandoned Road Hayek said a similar thing to Marx that: “That a change of ideas and the force of human will have made the world what it is now.” In a certain way this line told us the purpose why Hayek wrote this book, to prevent the horrible future from happening by awakening people’s mind and perception about it now.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Hayek firstly did a short conclusion of the history of ideas of Europe: “But the essential features of that individualism which, from elements provided by Christianity and the philosophy of classical antiquity, was first fully developed during the Renaissance and has since grown and spread into what we know as Western civilization—are the respect for the individual man qua man, that is, the recognition of his own views and tastes as supreme in his own sphere.”</p>
<p>I think it is necessary for me to introduce a principle of economic study here in case you are not familiar with it. It is called “rational decision”, which means individuals tend to maximize their interests from every economic decision they make, the integration of millions of decisions made by millions of people will result in economic growth and a better future. It is easy to tell how much this principle fits the idea of individualism and liberalism. Where does economic growth come from if you don’t even have the freedom and right to make the decision? </p>
<p>It was 1944 when this book was firstly published, The UK was at the end of the miserable WWII. After experiencing two times of world war and serious economic depression. Scholars began to reflect on whether the liberal constitutionalism brought that made Europe progressive and wealthy was still an effective method of social management nowadays, they started to consider that socialism was the better alternative. </p>
<p>Hayek believed that the reason for the left-wing ideological trend was because the progress brought about by the principle of individualism had become a norm, the relatively slow pace of progress was no longer satisfied by people, and people began to see the principle as an obstacle that urgently needed to be removed. “It might even be said that the very success of liberalism became the cause of its decline.”</p>
<p>In this chapter Hayek also mentioned why laissez faire is detrimental and the duty of governments in a free market. He will talk more about it in the following chapters.  </p>

          <p>In this chapter Hayek mentioned the forceful propaganda weapon socialisms use which is the promise of “new freedom” – “the great existing disparities in the range of choice of different people were to disappear.” This promise is so attractive that more and more liberalisms were seduced to the road to serfdom because they could not recognise the conflict between the principle of socialism and liberalism. </p>
<p>The expound of such conflict is the motif throughout the book, this chapter is focused on the observation of the striking similarities between the current socialism and authoritarian counties – Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union under the rule of Stalin </p>
<p>In this chapter, he quoted lines from Max Eastman: “Max Eastman, Lenin’s old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that “instead of being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism, more ruthless, barbarous, unjust, immoral, antidemocratic, unredeemed by any hope or scruple,” and that it is “better described as superfascist”; and when we find the same author recognizing that “Stalinism is socialism, in the sense of being an inevitable although unforeseen political accompaniment of the nationalization and collectivization which he had relied upon as part of his plan for erecting a classless society,”</p>
<p>Hayek thought that Fascism and Socialism were just like two denominations of one big religion, ruthlessly kill each other but adore the same lord above.</p>
<p>“No less significant is the intellectual history of many of the Nazi and Fascist leaders. Everyone who has watched the growth of these movements in Italy10 or in Germany has been struck by the number of leading men, from Mussolini downward (and not excluding Laval and Quisling), who began as socialists and ended as Fascists or Nazis.” </p>
<p>“It is true, of course, that in Germany before 1933, and in Italy before 1922, communists and Nazis or Fascists clashed more frequently with each other than with other parties. They competed for the support of the same type of mind and reserved for each other the hatred of the heretic. But their practice showed how closely they are related. To both, the real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in common and whom they could not hope to convince, is the liberal of the old type.” </p>
<p>In this chapter Hayek also quoted comments of scholars from different backgrounds to support his opinion towards socialism. </p>

          <p>Nowadays it is common sense that Friedrich August Von Hayek is a great economist and his masterpiece The Road to Serfdom is on the must-read list of every student study economic, politics and sociology. </p>
<p>However, this is not the case when this book was firstly published in 1944. After the trauma of two times of world war and huge economic turmoil, people began to question classical liberalism and to treat socialism as a better alternative. Left-wing ideas were the mainstream, among such current of thought Hayek stood out and appealed:” Do not go the road of the command economy, that’s a road of serfdom!” We can imagine how much criticisms were there on him. </p>
<p>Events that happened in the 20th century approved Hayek’s thoughts, especially after the new phenomenon of stagflation when inflation and economic recession occurred spontaneously after the 1973 oil crisis. Hayek’s liberalism and Milton Freedman’s monetarism were revalued and become the principle of the Reagan and Thatcher government; they brought a golden age of economic growth. </p>
<p>Nowadays the collapse of the Soviet Union and the miracle of China’s economic growth after it introduced free-market again supported Hayek. What is the magic of Hayek? How did he reemphasise and reform classical liberalism? </p>
<p>I think there are some important points that he made. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The free-market economy is the most efficient and ideal allocation system that human beings could find so far. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The economic freedom is the foundation of political freedom.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Freedom is only possible under the rule by law</p>
</li>
<li><p>Laws are telos(purpose), not means. Governments should OBEY the law to govern the society instead of USE the law.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Laissez faire is detrimental.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Democracy is merely a means to realize the liberty of individuals and stability of the society, it is not the telos. </p>
</li>
</ol>

          <p>The bureaucracy system is not necessarily an inefficient system at the very beginning, but as the orgnization grows with the additional duties and workers who carry the duties, the orgnizational structure will finally beome ineffeint.</p>
<p>While I was structuring this personal website, things were easy at first, I can found out where the bug is and fix it quickly. Thing became comlicated after I started to adding more functions to it becasue there are more and more codes in the database, the process of locating the problem is as hard as finding a “6” among one million “9”s. Last time it took me half the day to fix the dreadful bug that made the whole page a blank page.</p>
<p>I think that is why consluting comapanies are so expensive. To find the bug in an orignization with hundreds of thousands of people and duties and then fix it to imporve the efficiency of the firm.</p>
<p>Not an easy thing.</p>

          <p>(It is a social study programme that I did in the summer of 2019, I had a trip to the countryside of North JiangShu(苏北) and AnHui(安徽). I was too young to realize the economic problem behind it, even though what I wrote down is the actual image I saw, the report is still unrepresentative of the whole situation. In the 2-year time before I post this report online I went to more places of China, rural areas in the economically developed areas such as Shanghai(上海) and Zhejiang(浙江) are thriving and even the countryside in some “poor” provinces found their way out too. Again, what I wrote down is not a special case, but also not representative because China is too big) —— 2021/7/26   </p>
<p>Elders from the countryside are withering.</p>
<p>By the time when this report is finished, it was the end of the summer vacation. I spent almost the whole summer holiday walking around the rural areas of China, saw the condition of most of the elders from the countryside in China.</p>
<p>This topic seems like nonsense because human beings as a creature are supposed to be withering by the age. Indeed, I believe that everyone is witnessing the fading of themselves and the people around them all the time. Gradually, we are starting to be afraid of the annual physical examination, our hair is leaving our head and our bodies are getting tired easily. Like the poet described: “ When you are old and grey and full of sleep/And nodding by the fire.” Withering is happening every second on you and me, but what makes this process of ageing so special when it is about the elders in rural China? </p>
<p>I saw roughly the same picture in every countryside that I went: Air full of the disturbing sound of teenagers’ inferior motorcycles accompanied by the fitful coughing of old people sitting on the cane chair. It is hard to see people of working age on the road because it is almost impossible to have a job here. The depression itself is not sad, the sad thing is that the old people, no matter how hard they work, cannot avoid such a depression.</p>
<p>The majority of this generation was born before the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, at that time they worked hard but received little, as W. Somerset Maugham wrote in his book On a Chinese Screen, “In China it is man that is the beast of burden.” After that, it was the era of planned economy, because of the land reform they could directly feel the return of their labour without handling to the landlord, so they exhausted their energies to fulfil their Chinese Dream of having a fruitful, secured life. Since that until the Opening Up reformation that brought the free market to China, they had experienced the great Chinese Famine and the Culture Revolution. They are the most hard-working generation because of their unique youth experience, if you don’t work hard, you starve.  </p>
<p>Hard-working became their habit. They work until they can’t, they thought to chill is the crime of wasting your time. Their sons or daughters left their grandchildren in the village because they cannot take good care of them in such intensified work conditions in cities. Grandparents act as parents. Once their grandchildren are school-age that does not acquire so much energy to take care of, they will find a side business right away. Do anything they can to make a few bucks. The crops in the village are grown by these old people, it is common for a woman over seventy to plant twenty pounds of corn alone. </p>
<p>However, there is limited energy and life for humans. As time goes, this generation began to wither one after another, most of them worked to the end, few of them have chronic bedrest at the last stage of their life. Maybe for such a laborious generation, life ends when you cannot work. They are resistant to even being in the hospital as a waste of money. A few of them even committed suicide because they don’t have children to take care of them or the quality of care is poor. Who says farmers are irrational? To me, their rationality is hard to accept emotionally even though it is maybe the best choice in their position. As an onlooker, I feel sorry for them. </p>
<p>The appearance of new graves witnessed intuitively that a whole generation is becoming the past. The fields that they worked so hard to cultivate are being devoured by the luxuriant trees. The beautiful home that they devoted their lives to is not admired by youngers anymore. For some tombs, it is hardly to see people come and burn an incense stick.<br>——2019/8/23</p>
